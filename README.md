This Repo consist of Driver Monitoring task using Beaglebone Black and Arduino Nano 33 BLE

Problem Statement: The primary issue addressed by this project was the high incidence of road accidents attributable to driver negligence. Existing market solutions for driver monitoring were predominantly incorporated into high-end vehicles or were prohibitively expensive, limiting their accessibility and widespread adoption.

Objective: The project's objective was to develop a low-cost, efficient embedded computing device capable of monitoring the driver's state (Concentrated, Distracted, and Drowsy) using deep learning and CNN technologies. This device aimed to offer a viable solution that could be easily implemented in various vehicular systems without significant financial constraints.

Implementation: The implementation phase involved the collection of data from the State Farm driver detection system dataset available on Kaggle, which was used to train the CNN models. Several model architectures, including MobileNetV1, ShuffleNet, and custom designs, were evaluated for efficiency and compatibility with embedded devices. The models were quantized to reduce their size and computational requirements. Initial attempts to deploy the model on an Arduino BLE using the TensorFlow Micro library faced limitations due to hardware constraints.

Challenges Faced: A significant challenge encountered was the insufficient computational capacity of the Arduino Nano BLE, which only offered 1MB of tensor arena size, rendering it incapable of processing images effectively. This limitation necessitated a pivot in the implementation strategy.

Solution: To overcome the hardware limitations, the project transitioned to using the BeagleBone Black as the primary embedded computing platform. This required cross compiling the OpenCV library to facilitate model inference on the device. The initial suboptimal inference results, attributed to discrepancies between the testing conditions and the dataset, were addressed by employing data augmentation techniques to enhance the robustness of the model.

Results: The successful demonstration of the project was achieved through the establishment of a WebSocket-based connection between a webcam and the BeagleBone Black. This setup enabled real-time streaming of video data to the BeagleBone, where live inferences were performed to accurately detect and monitor the driver's facial expressions and state. This implementation showcased the system's effectiveness in providing a cost-effective solution for driver safety enhancement through real-time monitoring and state detection.

Conclusion: In conclusion, this project successfully tackled the issue of driver negligence by creating a cost-effective and efficient driver monitoring device using deep learning and CNN technologies. Despite hardware challenges, notably with the Arduino Nano BLE, the project pivoted to the BeagleBone Black, enabling real-time video streaming and live driver state detection through facial expression analysis. This approach not only makes advanced safety features more accessible across various vehicle types but also highlights the project's adaptability and potential for future enhancements in road safety technology.
